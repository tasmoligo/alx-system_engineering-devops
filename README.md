Systems engineers aim to optimize an organization's productivity by improving the efficiency of the company's workflows that involve technology. They do this by evaluating a company's existing systems and resources, including that company's hardware, software and personnel who use these technical systems. A systems engineer can then make, monitor and continually adjust optimizations to these systems as needed.</p>
